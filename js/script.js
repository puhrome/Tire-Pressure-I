//What are the Tire Pressures of each tire
//create an array to hold all 4 tire pressures
var tirePressure = [2.52, 3.44, 3.44, 2.43];
tirePressure [0] = "Front Right";
tirePressure [1] = "Front Left";
tirePressure [2] = "Rear Right";
tirePressure [3] = "Rear Left";

//still not comfortable with arrays
//need to practice more of this
